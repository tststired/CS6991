### Concurrency

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: JoinHandle<T> = thread::spawn(|| {
        let mut line = String::new();
        std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut line);
        return line;
    });
    // waiting for other sleep before executing 
    // thread returns to x after executing  
    // joinhandle is on the type returned by func
    loop {
        println!("hi");
        std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        // everytime thread goes to sleep it goes check on stdin readline
    }
}
```

### Mutex
- Guard critical region with some kind of exclusion lock
- Slow as balls 
- Acts on types
- Poison
- Send and sync only if sized 
```rust
pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>where
    F: FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,
    T: Send + 'static,

// FnOnce consumes the function and returns a join handler
// 'static, bounds for things the closures capture
// 'static asserts lifetime can be as long as required or right up to end of program, even past main calls
// ideally the function doesn't borrow anythign because of 'static
// see move for more details


pub struct Mutex<T: ?Sized> { /* private fields */ }
pub struct MutexGuard<'a, T: ?Sized + 'a> { /* private fields */ }
let x:Mutex<T> = Mutex::new(0) //0 represents unlocked state
pub fn lock(&self) -> LockResult<MutexGuard<'_, T>>

// RAII, aquisition is initialisation
// calling lock aquires the lock returning a mutexguard only way to RAII
// mutexguard will automatically unlock when dropped from scope

// Mutex poison happens when thread panics, that's the reason for LockRes
// Next access to MutexGuard, will cause the mutex to be poisoned 
// needs to be cleared 
// Crate parkinglot has auto clearing mutexs

```

### Cell and A Ref Cell
#### `T` is `Sync` if and only if `&T` is `Send`
- Sync and Send are auto marker traits, for structs and enums entire type has to comply

- `Send`  *owned types* that can be transferred across thread boundaries, doesn't allow concurrent because ownership is moved, allowing it to be thread safe. 

- `Sync` whether sharing *references* between threads is safe, allows concurrent usage between two threads

- Non `Sync` types have interior mutability in non thread safe forms such as `Cell` and `Refcell`, why is this `!Sync`, what if two m
  
- Allows overriding of shared borrow to forcefully mutate, cell is only synchronous single thread
	- Because Cell doesn't implement `sync`
	- Cell only valid for copy types for `fn get`
	- Arc is thread safe version

### Arc
- Atomically reference counted type
### Scope, all in one  thread joiner 
- Handy way to borrow data without using 'static data since scopes will ensure  threads are rejoined. 
- Scope call is blocking 

```rust
pub fn scope<'env, F, T>(f: F) -> Twhere
    F: for<'scope> FnOnce(&'scope Scope<'scope, 'env>) -> T,
// For is a higher ranked trait bound
// prolly don't have to deal with it, but pretty much unlimited lifetime 

```

```rust
let c = 6;
let chunks = digits_operators.chunks(length / c).collect::<Vec<_>>();
thread::scope(|x| {
	for i in chunks {
		x.spawn(|| {
		i.iter().for_each(|(digits, operators)| {
		let _ = calculate(digits.to_vec(), operators.to_vec());
// scope provides the |x| which is a borrow of scoped object
// for function to spawn threads
```

```rust
let mut a = vec![1, 2, 3];
let mut x = 0;
println!("1");
thread::scope(|s| {
    s.spawn(|| {
        println!("3/4");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        dbg!(&a);
    });
    s.spawn(|| {
        println!("3/4");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        x += a[0] + a[2];
    });
    println!("2");
});
println!("5");

// scope forces program to wait for all threads to complete before exec
// last thread print, order of output is as numbered
```

### Move Closures
- Moving item into closure with move keyword, we want this because thread closure can outlive current function. Macros can sometimes borrow instead of own 
- `Move` moves captures into closure ownership, and borrows from within the closure on captured objects can still work
```rust
let x = String::from("x");
std::thread::spawn( move || {
	let x_ref = &x
// the reason we need to move is because rust doesn't know how long 
// thread lives for and any borrow needs a ensure that the 
// captured x is valid even after main dies

let x: &'static str = "helo"
struct AutogenClosure<'a> {
	string_a: &'a str,
}'
// rust autogen can't see string literals are 'static so they're a bit stupid and assumes its a reborrow instead of a 'static, ????????? incomplete maybe wrong
```

### Read/Write Locks
- Smart Mutex, checks since mutex assumes everyone is a writer on lock
- RwLocks checks the same way as borrow checker, 1 `&mut`  and inf `&`
- Consecutive RwLocks can deadlock 
```
// Thread 1             |  // Thread 2
let _rg = lock.read();  |
                        |  // will block
                        |  let _wg = lock.write();
let _rg = lock.read();  | // death can't get write
```

### Channels MPSC 
- Multiple producer single consumer (MPSC), as many threads can send only one receive
- Passing messages across threads,  
- Sender has to implement a `.send(T)`  method, and receiver has to implement `.rec(T)`
- Receiver `rec(T)` is blocking until something sends a message across with `.send(T)`

```rust
let (sender, reciever) = mpsc::channel::<String>()
std::thread::spawn(move|| {
	sender.clone().send(String::from("hellow"))
})
std::thread::spawn(move|| {
	sender.clone().send(String::from("hello2w"))
})
std::thread::spawn(|| {
	let a = receiver.recv().unwrap();
})
```

#### Bound channel
- Since channel usually implemented with `vecdeq` and if there are more sender outputs than receivers, `vecdeq`  can overflow to infinite memory.
- Bound Channels blocks sends until buffer is cleared. 
#### Rendezvous channel
- 0 sized bound channel, sender blocks until receiver requests and item. 
- Receive blocks until sender sends as well.


### Send/Sync Rc 
- `Rc`is not send 
```rust
let x = Rc::new(1)
let y = x.clone()
std::thread::spawn(move || {
	drop(y);
}); 
drop (x);
// can result double drop or memory leak, since drop is not atomic 
// imagine current count is 2, thread A views count, thread B views count
// both decrement from their POV, nothing is freed despite true val 0 
let x = Rc::new(1)
std::thread::spawn(move || {
	let z = x.clone();
	drop(z);
}); 
std::thread::spawn(move || {
	let y= x.clone();
	drop(y);
}); 
drop (x);
// Double free, z gets a clone, there is a data race on reading the value 
// of the current counter, they both increment to 2 instead of 3, later 
	// when drop is called, two frees happen since the it frees on drop at // count 1
