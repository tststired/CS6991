### Function Pointers

```rust
let _name_: fn(_argType_) -> (_argTypeReturn_)  = _somefunction_
```


### Implementing your own Map
```Rust
struct<I, A, B> MyMap {
	iter: I,
	function: fn(A) -> B
}
// this struct needs to hold the iterator and the function pointer
// function holds the address of the anonymous function declared in main
// otherwise when we implement iterator wtf do we do
// my_map is just responsible for instantiating this struct
// no type restrictions on this thing since my_map already does

impl<I, A, B> Iterator for MyMap<I, A, B> {
	where I: Iterator<Item = A>
	type Item = B;
	fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
		let curr = self.iter.next()?;
		let new = (self.function)(curr)
		Some(new)
	}
}
// self.iter.next calls iterr and it returns an A type object 
// wrap function with brackets to make it not look for an impl of func
// I needs to be iterator trait bounded, and it returns items of A


fn my_map<I, A, B>(iter: I, function: fn(A)->B)
where 
	I: Iterator<Item = A>
	{MyMap {}}
// takes in an iterator, applies function to each item
// tells iterator the item we are iterating over is A 
// iterators don't actually mutate the passed in iterator
// we just pass out a new iterator with the transformation 

fn main() {
	let vec = vec![1,2,3,4]
	let mapped = my_map(vec.into_iter(), |x| x as f32 + 1) .filter (xxx)
}
// passes my_map an iterator and a function, it returns 
// a struct of myMap which we can then iterate on with filter
// we dont care what the type of thing mapped is but each func on 
// mapped has to return an tierator to keep chaining
```

### Closure 
- Function pointer + environment (capture)
- Closures implement `FnOnce`
- Closures can be treated as a function pointer if no environment capture

```Rust
struct<I, F> MyMap {
	iter: I,
	function: F,
}

impl<I, F, A, B> Iterator for MyMap<I, F> {
	where 
		I: Iterator<Item = A>
		F: Fn(A) -> B
	{		
		type Item = B;
		fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
			let curr = self.iter.next()?;
			let new = (self.function)(A)
			Some(new)
	}
}

fn my_map<I, A, F, B>(iter: I, function: F) -> MyMap<I, F>
where 
	I: Iterator<Item = A>
	F: Fn(A) -> B
	{MyMap {iter, function}}

fn main() {
	let vec = vec![1,2,3,4]
	let factor = 2
	let mapped = my_map(vec.into_iter(), |x| x as f32 + factor) .filter (xxx)
}
// reason this works is struct doesnt care what the thing is as long as it imp Fn
// Fn automatically implemented by closures that take immutable ref to captured 
// variables or don't capture anything and act as function pointers
// all iterator does is run function on curr item it doesnt care what the thing is
```

### FnMut/FnOnce/Fn
#### Closure trait implementation determined by how environment captured
- `FnOnce` takes ownership, implies function can only be called once
	- Closure moves something from environment into capture
- `FnMut` needs exclusive borrow, function is expected to have exclusive access
	- Closure captures shared and exclusive borrows
-  `Fn` needs shared borrow, as many non mutable shared access as you want 
	- Closure captures shared borrows only

##### FnOnce > FnMut > Fn > fn
- All `Fn`  can be treated as `FnOnce`, and etc.

### Closure Syntax
```rust
    let expensive_closure = |num: u32| -> u32 {
        println!("calculating slowly...");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2));
        num
    };
    // closure syntax are as follows
    | paramaters: optional type| -> return value {body} //optional brace

	fn  add_one_v1   (x: u32) -> u32 { x + 1 }
	let add_one_v2 = |x: u32| -> u32 { x + 1 };
	let add_one_v3 = |x|             { x + 1 };
	let add_one_v4 = |x|               x + 1  ;
	// similar to function syntax
```
