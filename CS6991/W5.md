## Polymorphism
- Not that OOP, can do some OOP stuff but doesn't enforce it 
- No inheritance 

## Generics type parameters (Parametric Polymorphism)
- `<T, U, V>`  annotate arbitrary type names 
-  Turbofish syntax to explicitly use a type parameter for a generic method/func
	- `mything.iter().collect::<Vec<i32>>` 
		- collect may require explicit syntax since collect excepts `<T>` 


### Bounded 
```rust
fn smallest<T: std::comp::PartialOrd>(x:T, y: T) -> T {
where 
	T: std::comp::PartialOrd,
	T: default
if x < y { x } else { y }
```

-  Appends some restriction to ensure function always works 
-  By binding `T` that implements `PartialOrd` we can ensure any type can use this func
-  Can write in angle brackets or define after with `where`

```Rust
fn smallest<T, I>(xs: Vec<T>) -> T {
fn smallest<T>(xs: impl IntoIterator<Item = T>) -> Option<T>
fn smallest <I>(xs: I) -> Option<T> {
	where 
		I: IntoIterator<Item = T>,
		T: PartialOrd,
	...
}
```

-  Can replace vec container with anything that implements `intoiterator`
-   Can also write inline `impl`

### Traits 
-  In trait declarations as bounds on [associated types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html#associated-types): `trait A { type B: Copy; }` is equivalent to `trait A where Self::B: Copy { type B; }`.

### Monomorphization
- Static dispatch, chooses which function to be called at compile time 
- Every version of called generic function is generated allows individual optimisation, 

### `Dyn`
-  Opposite of monomorphization, generally slower
- Dynamic dispatch allows rust to know size and types when they're unknown as long as it implements some `Trait`
- Allows resolution of which method to call on runtime 
- used to clarify trait and trait objects 

### Trait Objects 
```rust
pub struct Screen {
    pub components: Vec<Box<dyn Draw>>,
}
```
- This vector is of type `Box<dyn Draw>`, which is a trait object; itâ€™s a stand-in for any type inside a `Box` that implements the `Draw` trait.
- A trait object points to both an instance of a type implementing our specified trait and a vtable used to look up trait methods on that type at runtime.

```rust
// define an example struct, make it printable
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Foo;

// an example trait
trait Bar {
    fn baz(&self);
}

// implement the trait for Foo
impl Bar for Foo {
    fn baz(&self) {
        println!("{:?}", self)
    }
}

// This is a generic function that takes any T that implements trait Bar.
// It must resolve to a specific concrete T at compile time.
// The compiler creates a different version of this function
// for each concrete type used to call it so &T here is NOT
// a trait object (as T will represent a known, sized type
// after compilation)
fn static_dispatch<T>(t: &T)
where
    T: Bar,
{
    t.baz(); // we can do this because t implements Bar
}

// This function takes a pointer to a something that implements trait Bar
// (it'll know what it is only at runtime). &dyn Bar is a trait object.
// There's only one version of this function at runtime, so this
// reduces the size of the compiled program if the function
// is called with several different types vs using static_dispatch.
// However performance is slightly lower, as the &dyn Bar that
// dynamic_dispatch receives is a pointer to the object +
// a vtable with all the Bar methods that the object implements.
// Calling baz() on t means having to look it up in this vtable.
fn dynamic_dispatch(t: &dyn Bar) {
    // ----------------^
    // this is the trait object! It would also work with Box<dyn Bar> or
    // Rc<dyn Bar> or Arc<dyn Bar>
    //
    t.baz(); // we can do this because t implements Bar
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo;
    static_dispatch(&foo);
    dynamic_dispatch(&foo);
}
```


- Trait objects cannot have a generic parameter inside 
- Trait objects also always unsized, the pointer however is sized `dyn Animal` unsized
```rust 

fn all_animals_greet(animals: Vec<Box<dyn Animals>>) {}
// Animals atm a trait object however
trait Animals {
	...
	fn say_hello_to<A>(&self, animals: &A) -> String 
	where A: Animal; 
}
// this isn't allowed since when we normally with static dispatch
// we pregen functions for everythign that calls it 
// however with dynamic dispatch we don't know what functions to generate
// since it only knows the types on runttime 

Solution1: 
trait Animals {
	...
	fn say_hello_to(&self, animals: &dyn Animals) -> String 
}

Solution2: 
trait Animals {
	...
	fn say_hello_to(&self, animals: Animals) -> String 
	where Self: sized
}
//this solution removes this function from any dyn dispatch call
// can only be called by monomorphisim functions
```
