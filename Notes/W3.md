## Borrows

#### Todo
- google noalias/zerocost abstract
### Clone Trait
- Clone is a super trait of copy 
- The ability to explicitly duplicate an object by calling `.clone()`
	-  Each cloned item is independent from each other

### Copy Trait
- Types whose values can be duplicated by just copying the exact bits
	- String type can't implement copy exact bits of  var since its a heap allocated string and the var only has the pointer to it
- Copies happen implicitly as part of assignment (same way move is used)

### Ownership 
- Structs owns everything within itself 

### Races
- Read Read concurrency is fine
- Read write is not fine , Iterator invalidation could point to freed data after reallocation from expansion

### Shared xor mutable Idea
- Share xor mutable, can pick one option but not both (technically none works)
- Temporal value: can swap between if value is not being used in either state atm
	- At compile time temporal value is checked


### Methods
- methods are similar to functions
- key difference is methods are defined within the context of a struct/enum/trait obj
-  first parameter is always `self`
-  First way of calling `area()` is called method syntax where second is using paths
	- https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/paths.html
	- method syntax implicitly passes object into first parameter
- May implicitly deference or borrow in order to correctly call method

```Rust
struct Rectangle (u32, u32);
impl Rectangle {
	fn area(&self) -> u32 {
		self.0 * self.1
	}
}
fn main() {
	let rect1 = Rectangle(30,50);
	let rect2 = Rectangle(30,50);
	println!("{} {}", rect1.area(),Rectangle::area(&rect2));
}
```


###  meself myself and iself/`self &self &mut self`

- `self` takes ownership of object instance
- `&self` takes a shared borrow of object instance
- `&mut self` takes an exclusive mutable borrow of object instance

### References
- Technically pointers but with special borrow checking rules
- So references to references work but rare
- Deref trait will deference as many times as it takes to match whatever it needs
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html


### Shared Borrow/Immutable reference`&`
-  During shared borrows guarantees no mutability on object (xor idea)
-  Infinite shares, very cheap to share around, read-only
-  inheritance of borrowing, prevents passing `&mut` to child when object is shared borrow
-  Are copy type, so you can take infinite references 

### Exclusive Borrow/Mutable reference `&mut`
-  Can only mutable borrow from a mutable object
-  Only one exclusive borrow can exist at a time, when obj is returned then can borrow
-  Are not copy type, so you can't take more than one 
	-  Can give people power to mutable/shared borrow see reborrow

### Re borrow
- Reborrow references a borrow to reborrow it again. 
- Temporarily stops the ability to use original borrow until reborrow is completed 
	- `&mut *`  is  implicitly inserted to do this 
	- Might need to manually insert it for generics

	- https://old.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/vl1gah/obscure_rust_reborrowing_is_a_halfbaked_feature/
```rust
let mut num = 32_u32;

let a = &mut num;
let b: &mut _ = a; // Create reborrow

[let b: &mut _ = &mut *a;] //actual inserted line

*b += 1;           // `b` has all privileges, so we can use it
                   // `b` goes out of scope
*a += 1;           // It is OK to use `a` again
```

### Dangling references
- Pointing to something that doesn't exists 
- Rust doesn't seem to have this issue with lifetimes

### Slices
- Slices unify contiguous containers so it works on arrays/vec, Strings/str
	- Both vec/String heap allocated, str arr stack allocated
- Slice syntax type is written as `[T]`  where T is any type
	- Now `[i32]` works with both arrays and vecs
- Slices have to be referenced `&[T]` , now we know the size, which is the ptr size
	- Slices are by default not sized, can't directly use
	- Rust needs to know locals at compile time 
	-  https://poignardazur.github.io/2022/02/23/rust-unsized-vars-analysis/
- `&[T]` technically holds two  pointers one for len and one for ptr addr
- `&_varname_[1..n]` gives a slice of elements `1->n`
- `&mut [T]` can only modify slice elem and not expand/shrink parent structure

### Iterators
- `Into_iters(self)` consumption of item passed in returning some `T`
- `iter(&self)` takes in shared borrow of item returning some `&T`
- `iter_mut(&mut self)` takes in shared borrow of item returning some `&mut T`


### Lifetimes
- Compiler needs to know lifetimes of everything at compile time
- Elision is omission of lifetimes, let compiler figure it out
- Lifetime associated to `&` , so `&'a mut _type_`  is the proper way to annotate mut ref
- Non-lexical lifetimes, auto shorten lifetimes 
- Lifetimes can't fix dangling references they can only assist compiler in deducing lifetimes
- Structs/enums with references in them may need lifetimes 

- Lifetimes are how long something can be alive for 
- Example below `cord` takes in two different length lifetimes. To match `new_cord` needs separate lifetimes. The struct also has to be annotated with lifetimes because the struct elements have to be specified on how long they live. Struct itself is invalid if something in it is invalid
- Unsure but the struct itself doesn't have a lifetime specified here
```Rust
struct Cord<'a, 'b> {
    x: &'a i32,
    y: &'b i32
}

fn new_cord<'a, 'b>(x:&'a i32, y:&'b i32) -> Cord<'a, 'b> {
    Cord { x: &x, y: &y }
}

fn main () {
    let x = 1;
    {
        let y = 2; 
        let out = new_cord(&x, &y);
        println!("{0}~{1} ", out.x, out.y)
        
    }
}
```
### Named lifetimes `<'a>`
- For manual annotation of lifetime
### Blank lifetime `<'_>`
- Let compiler infer this lifetime 
### Static lifetime `<'static >`
- legends never die
