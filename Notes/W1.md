### Rust: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_type_and_reference_type
- Value types store data, reference types are implicitly accessed via references 
- References are different from pointers 
- Structs and traits replace classes in rust 
- Statically typed language, all types are known at compile-time
	- For variable assignment with expression bindings, all flows of control must end with same type
- Strongly typed language,  difficult to bypass restrictions imposed by language 

### Mutability
- Bindings can be mutated with the `mut` keyword but the variable type cannot be mutted

### Shadowing 
- Temporarily mutate an immutable variable by declaring the same variable name
	- Re-declaring variable doesn't mutate old var but reassigns binding 
- Within inner scopes, shadowing rules are temporary

### Let statements, Initializer
- In C It consists of the '=' character followed by an expression or a comma-separated list of expressions placed in curly brackets (braces). 
- The latter list is sometimes called the "initializer list" or "initialization list" (although the term "initializer list" is formally reserved for initialization of class/struct members in C++; 

### Expression - Statement 
- Expressions produce a value 
- Function definitions are statements, however calling a function is an expression
- Expressions are implicitly returned at the end of a function by omitting `;` 
- Ifs are expressions in rust not statements, can bind results of expression to vars 
- `;` semicolon discards the result of an expression, evaluating return value to unit type 
```
Let Statements:
	Let [Pattern] =(Initializer) [Expression]
	Variable names are a type of pattern
	Let 
```

### Never type `!`
- Represents the type where they never resolve to any value at all
- `!`  can also be coerced into any other type
-  Used to detect unreachable code based on code after a never type
- exit, break, continue, return all return never type
```Rust 
fn exit(code: i32) -> !               ###unresolved
let num: u32 = match get_a_number() { ###coerceion
    Some(num) => num,
    None => break,
};
```

### Unit Type `()`
- The unit type has the value of `()`  and is returned when no other meaningful value is returned
- Is implicit to functions without a return value 
- Implication is every function has a return type
```Rust
fn long () -> () {
	println!("nothing returned")
}
```

### If Expression
- No ternary operator in Rust
- If expressions conditionals only except booleans 

### Break and loops 
- Break implicitly returns a unit type but can also be used to return a value
- Break and loops are both expressions and can be used to return values

### Ownership 
- Each object only has one owner, each item can only have one binding without borrow
- Compile time will check all object ownership
- Simple types `i32, bool, char` have no ownership semantics
	- Complex types (struct/enum/vec/etc) of simple types also have no ownership 

### Tuple 
- Bind stuff together idk 
- Used to return a bundle of crap 

### Arrays/Vectors
- Array is a fixed sized array lmao
- Vectors are resizable arrays

### Options/Enums/Results W2 apparently
- Can return `Some(T)` or `None`
- Options require unwrapping 
	- Match unwraps instead of options
	- match better since unwrapping panics and quit and match allows custom results on none reesult
- `?`  not really sure
- Options are enums?
- look never type
- `expect("string")` look
- star operator low precedence, applied last
- look closure
- look transpose
- can nest options/results
